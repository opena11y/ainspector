      Rule categories are an alternative to WCAG Guidelines for grouping related rules. The Rule Categories are based on HTML element types to make it easier for web designers and developers to understand WCAG accessibility
      requirements.

  <dl style="margin-top: 1em;">
      <dt>Landmarks</dt>
      <dd>
          Use <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/index.html">ARIA landmark roles</a> to structure the content of each page and identify major sections of content, thus making them more findable and
          navigable.
      </dd>
      <dd>The use of landmarks will, in many cases, reflect the visual styling and page layouts that web designers utilize to set apart various sections of content.</dd>
      <dt>Headings</dt>
      <dd>Use heading elements (H1-H6) to identify sections and subsections of content in a web page.</dd>
      <dd>Headings can also be used to provide accessible names for landmarks using the <code>aria-labelledby</code> attribute.</dd>
      <dt>Color/Content</dt>
      <dd>
          Use proper HTML markup to identify the semantics and language of text content. Ensure that text is readable by adhering to color contrast requirements, and that information is not conveyed solely by the use of color, shape,
          location or sound.
      </dd>
      <dt>Images</dt>
      <dd>Provide appropriate text alternatives for static images and graphics.</dd>

      <dt>Forms</dt>
      <dd>Provide meaningful labels for form elements and usable and understandable error feedback as needed.</dd>
      <dt>Widgets/Scripts</dt>
      <dd>Use appropriate event handlers on elements to support native interactivity using JavaScript.</dd>
      <dd>Ensure that custom widgets created using JavaScript support keyboard interaction and include ARIA markup to describe their roles, properties and states.</dd>
      <dt>Audio/Video</dt>
      <dd>Provide appropriate text transcripts, captions or audio descriptions for elements used in rendering audio and video content.</dd>
      <dt>Keyboard Support</dt>
      <dd>

      </dd>
      <dt>Timing/Live Regions</dt>
